1st landing page done in html and javascript
This is before I finished HTML and CSS in Codecademy. I was getting bored and wanted to challenge myself. I googled everything that I didn't know how to do which was 90%
I struggled with the NavBar. Mainly separating the Navbar Tags/Items. I used display: inline-flex to separate I believe. 
Used left and right to position item on page.
